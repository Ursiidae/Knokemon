		  "The world of pokemon--incredible to behold, the home to the most
		  mysterious of all creatures. In the forest, up in the skies, and in the 
		  seas; Pokemon can be found in all places around this world. The lives 
		  of people and pokemon have been found together since the beginning of 
		  time sharing the bonds of trust and respect. And now we stumble upon 
		  a young trainer--" You(The Pokemon Movie)!
		  </p>
		  <p>
		  Trainers spend  hours travelling through the Pokemon regions battling 
		  and bonding with your pokemon team as you try to catch them all, filling 
		  your Pokedex one pokemon at a time. Now as you approach the ultimate 
		  goal of completing all of the pokedexes, catching all 802 pokemon on 
		  all of your games or maybe just the pokedex on your specific game...
		  </p>
		  <h3>
		    It is up to you!
		  </h3>
		  <p> 
		  Because <i> everyone's </i> game is different. We understand that about
		  trainers, because we are one just like you! Here players can connect to
		  an online community where you can meet others just like you too, but 
		  that isn't all. Kno-kemon is an entirely website based Pokedex where 
		  can create personalized Pokedexes that fit <i> your </i> game.
